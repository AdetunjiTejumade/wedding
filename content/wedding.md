# Dress 

We could describe the right attire for this event as "dressy-casual". One would likely benefit from a more comfortable shoe at the ranch, as the ground at Willow-Witt is uneven dirt and woodchips. Willow-Witt Ranch is at 5000 ft elevation and may be up to 10 degrees cooler than Ashland on the day, so maybe bring an extra layer if you run cold.
